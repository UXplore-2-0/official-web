Dear participant,<br /><br />

I hope this email finds you well. We are reaching out to inform you about an
important requirement regarding your registration for Mora UXplore 2.0.
<br /><br />

According to the event guidelines, registered teams must consist of a minimum of
two members and a maximum of three members to be considered valid. Upon
reviewing our records, we have noticed that your team currently has only one
member, which unfortunately does not meet the minimum requirement for team
validity. <br /><br />

To ensure that your team's registration is valid and eligible to participate in
Mora UXplore 2.0, we kindly request that you add additional members to your team
as soon as possible. The registration deadline is approaching, and all teams
must comply with the guidelines by the registration deadline, which is on the
13th of March 2024 at 11:59 PM. <br /><br />

Adding more members to your team not only ensures your team's eligibility but
also enhances collaboration and diversity of perspectives, which are valuable
assets in such events. <br /><br />

<strong>Here are the steps to add members to your team:</strong> <br />
<ol>
  <li>
    Log in to your team’s account by clicking the
    <strong>“Log in”</strong> button on the website.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once logged in, navigate to the <strong>"Add Members"</strong> sidebar tab.
  </li>
  <li>Click on the "Add Member" button.</li>
  <li>
    Enter the details of the member you’re adding, and click the “Add Member”
    button there to confirm the addition.
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat this procedure separately for each team member, including the team
    leader.
  </li>
</ol>
