Dear participant,<br /><br />

We hope this email finds you well. This is to inform you that the deadline for
adding team members for Mora UXplore 2.0 has now passed. <br /><br />

As per our previous communication, all registered teams are required to consist
of a minimum of two members and a maximum of three members to be considered
valid as per the competition guidelines. While we encourage team collaboration,
we&apos;ve noted that not all teams were able to meet this requirement within
the specified timeframe. <br /><br />

Despite this, we&apos;re pleased to announce that you can continue participating
in Mora UXplore 2.0 from the upcoming workshop onward. Our first workshop is
scheduled for today,
<strong>March 20th, 2024, at 5:30 PM</strong>. During this session, we will
reveal the details for round 1 of the event, which will officially open at 10:00
PM today itself. <br /><br />

We believe in the value of your participation and are excited to have you on
board as we journey through Mora UXplore 2.0 together. <br /><br />

If any of your team members are not yet added to the &quot;Registrants&quot;
group, feel free to reach out to us at
<strong>076 974 7344 and 076 464 3713</strong> .&nbsp; <br /><br />

Best regards, <br />
