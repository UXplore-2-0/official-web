Dear participants, <br /><br />

As you prepare for Round 01 of Mora UXplore 2.0, this is to clarify the
requirements of the Task: <br /><br />

1. Design: Create designs for both mobile and web interfaces focusing on
sustainable and community tourism in Sri Lanka. <br />
2. Prototype URLs: Provide accessible prototype URLs for both interfaces. <br />
3. Source file: Include the source file for your designs. <br />
4. Wireframes: Submit wireframes for mobile and desktop views. <br /><br />

Feel free to use any design tool of your choice. Remember, we're looking for
design concepts, not fully developed solutions. Additionally, demonstrating
creativity in expressing the topic can be beneficial. <br /><br />

Please ensure your submissions meet these criteria. Should you require any
further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact us. <br /><br />

Thank you for your participation! <br /><br />

Best regards, <br />
Methmini Madhushika <br />
Team Handling Committee Lead <br />
